# A deep-learning-based score to evaluate multiple sequence alignments

This repository enables predicting MSA quality by computing features and using one of two deep learning models.

In order to calculate the features for a directory of MSAs, use the multiple_msa_calc_features_and_labels from the multi_msa_service.py

The unit-tests on tests/sp_alt_spec.py provide examples for runing and testing the features creation.
